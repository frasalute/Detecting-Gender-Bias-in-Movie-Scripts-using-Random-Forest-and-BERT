# Gender Bias Detection in Movie Scripts using Machine Learning and NLP

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **gender bias** in movie scripts using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning techniques. Inspired by the research paper *"Gender Stereotypes in Hollywood Movies and Their Evolution over Time: Insights from Network Analysis"* by Kumar Arjun et al. (2022), the analysis explores the distribution of dialogues, word usage, and character attributes across genders.

The dataset is sourced from [Convokit](https://convokit.cornell.edu), containing **9035 speakers**, **304,713 utterances**, and **83,097 conversations**.

## Key Features
1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   - Text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
   - Feature engineering: line length, word count, and credit position.

2. **Embeddings & Feature Extraction**:
   - **TF-IDF** and **Count Vectorization** for traditional NLP features.
   - Integration of **BERT** and **RoBERTa embeddings** for semantic understanding.

3. **Models Implemented**:
   - **Naive Bayes (Multinomial and Bernoulli)**
   - **Logistic Regression** (with hyperparameter tuning)
   - **Random Forest** (basic and fine-tuned)
   - Random Forest and Logistic Regression using **BERT** and **RoBERTa** embeddings.

4. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Accuracy scores range from **54%** to **65%** across models.
   - Fine-tuning techniques and cross-validation used to address overfitting.

5. **Visualization & Insights**:
   - Gender-based line length, word count distributions, and role prominence.
   - Confusion matrices and running time comparisons across models.

## Results Summary
| Model                        | Accuracy |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Multinomial Naive Bayes      | 54%      |
| Bernoulli Naive Bayes        | 63%      |
| Logistic Regression          | 60%      |
| Random Forest (Untuned)      | 92%      *(Overfitting)*|
| Random Forest (Fine-Tuned)   | 65%      |
| Random Forest + BERT         | 65%      |
| Logistic Regression + BERT   | 60%      |
| Random Forest + RoBERTa      | 65%      |
| Logistic Regression + RoBERTa| 60%      |

> *Note*: Overfitting was evident in initial Random Forest implementations, but mitigated with hyperparameter tuning.
