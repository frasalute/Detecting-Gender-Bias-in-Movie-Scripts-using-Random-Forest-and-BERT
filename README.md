# Detecting-Gender-Bias-in-Movie-Scripts-using-Random-Forest-and-BERT

Inspired by the research conducted by Kumar Arjun, Goh Jasmine, Tan Tiffany, and Siew Cynthia (2022) titled "Gender Stereotypes in Hollywood Movies and Their Evolution over Time: Insights from Network Analysis."
Dataset taken from Convokit, and the corpus presented 9035 speakers, 304713 utterances and 83097 conversations.

Tested with different models, initially the Random Forest performed better than the others, showing a case of overfitting.
The improvement in accuracy was only 10% from the worst to the best model.
Appear to be unsuccessful despite fine-tuning and usage of BERT and RoBERTa.
